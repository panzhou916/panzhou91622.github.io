This site was made possible thanks two people.
First, the creator of the super-duper, modular, great-looking, dynamic and responsive <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/" class="textlink" target="_blank">Minimal Mistakes</a> template, <a href="https://mademistakes.com/" class="textlink" target="_blank">Michael Rose</a>.
Second, my regards go to <a href="http://jponttuset.github.io/" class="textlink" target="_blank">Jordi Pont-Tuset</a>, who created <a href="http://jponttuset.github.io/building-an-academic-website/" class="textlink" target="_blank">this</a> wonderful guide summarizing how to setup Minimal Mistakes, and more importantly, creating a modular *Publications* section where one can easily export HTML code directly from BibTeX entries.
At this point, I would like to clap for <a href="http://txn.name/index.html" class="textlink" target="_blank">Truong X. Nghiem</a> for the <a href="http://txn.name/publist.html" class="textlink" target="_blank">PubList</a> plugin he developed to work with <a href="http://jabref.sourceforge.net/" class="textlink" target="_blank">JabRef</a>, in order to easily export BibTeX entries into an HTML file.

After all the setup, there were bits and pieces to do to customize the layout to my taste and fix a few issues for the mobile version; yet it was totally worth it at the end!
No man is happier than the one with a mobile-friendly, easy to manage, good-looking and functional personal webpage!
If you end up liking a change I have made to the original template, feel free to "steal" it from my source code on <a href="https://github.com/kayaogz" class="textlink" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

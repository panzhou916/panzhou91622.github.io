There, and back again! I was the winner of the 2nd HPC Hackathon at BSC.
It was a great pleasure to participate (for the last time!) in this hackathon involving 18 hours of pushing coding and HPC skills to the extreme! I would like to thank again all the organizers and sponsors (Nvidia and Intel) for this great event.
